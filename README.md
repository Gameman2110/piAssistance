# piAssistance
---
PiAssistance is an open source project for pi robots and voice assistances. This can be used in many ways and the plan is to expand it so you can use
it in any enviroment you want. As always I priority easy to use installations and setups for the bots. Please note: This bot is under development and code could change and be fasters. There for we don't recommend using this for your next "big project". Instead you can use this for testing of your robot. But please keep in mind that the code could be buggy & crash. 

## The folders :file_folder:
When you extract the .zip file you will see lots of folders and files. In this section I will be talking on what you will need to use and configure depending on what robot or what project you are making. If I's an assistance with face recognition & voice controlls or if it's an robot that simply use motors and move. Everything you will need to know about the folders will be here. Also feel free to ask me if you have any questions.
